# Weather_Station
I developed this code to help a school that wanted to integrate weather studies into their sciences curriculum.

What does this code do:

•	User-friendly dialog for loading the datafile.

•	Takes the instrument generated datafile and breaks it into usable data frames.

•	Visualizes all variables in a comprehensive dashboard.

•	Updates the dashboard in real time.


Still under development.
